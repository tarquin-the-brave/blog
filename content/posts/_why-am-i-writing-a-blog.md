Yeah, good question.  It's really time consuming.

There's not a huge amount else that I'm doing at the minute with the
Coronavirus lockdown, but I started this well before that, so there's other
reasons beyond idle boredom.

I feel like I've benefited quite a lot from tech blogs existing out in the
world.

They can serve as good references for language features or tools when their
official documentation is found wanting.  Although I don't really want to write
articles like that.  I'd rather contribute to official documentation.

They're also great for encountering ideas that you wouldn't otherwise encounter
within a single company.  I think it's very easy for a group think to set in as
a subset of ideas are rewarded and encouraged and diversity of thought
converges as people seek each other's approval.

But really, I'm doing this for my own education.  By blogging about things I'm
in the process of learning I can really solidify what I've learned[^haskell].
By writing blogs that state an opinion of how things should be[^ide], I get to
track through time how what I think is important has developed, and maybe even
reason that my more contemporary thoughts are better.

I've enabled commenting so anyone who finds my blog can add their thoughts.
You learn so much by being wrong about things.

A goal of mine is to be able to look back a year and cringe a bit.  Because if
I'm cringing it means I've learned enough in that time to know that what I
previously wrote isn't quite right.
