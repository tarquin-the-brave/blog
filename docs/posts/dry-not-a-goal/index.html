    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself&rdquo;, is often described as a &ldquo;principle&rdquo; of
software engineering.  I looked up what &ldquo;principle&rdquo; is defined to mean and
Google says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation
for a system of belief or behaviour or for a chain of reasoning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe in this case that&rsquo;s a bit strong.  I&rsquo;d think in the case of a software
principle we&rsquo;re talking more about an idea of how things should be, or a
guide<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to decision making.</p>
<p>But anyway.  I find quite often, when seeing discussion about software, DRY
ends up being front and centre, the main focus of what someone wants to
achieve.  People argue for DRY &ldquo;at any cost&rdquo;.  Is it really worth eliminating
every ounce of repetition if the result is completely unreadable and
unmaintainable code?  An answer to that could take us down the route of &ldquo;DRY
done right&rdquo;, &ldquo;DRY done wrong&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m sure there will be endless articles out
there that are titled as such.  But I find that whenever you see discussion
around &ldquo;principle X done right&rdquo;, &ldquo;principle X done wrong&rdquo;, that serves as an
indicator that there&rsquo;s something quite leaky about the principle. ⛲</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s better to think of DRY as an indicator that abstractions are good,
rather than something to shoot for in of itself.</p>
<p>Like in Economics, &ldquo;full employment&rdquo; can be a sign that an economy is generally
healthy, but can&rsquo;t be a goal above all else.  We could employ everyone in the
postal service: we&rsquo;d have full employment, but no food.  I only did Economics
up to GCSE, so maybe there&rsquo;s more to the story than that, but you get the
picture.</p>
<p>As stupid as this comparison might be, I see this happening in software.  DRY
seems to be an obsession for some developers, and then once achieved: &ldquo;the
answer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I wonder why this is.  Perhaps because it&rsquo;s easy, visible, and safe.  No-one
disagrees in general that less repetition is better, so unless they know the
specifics of what you&rsquo;re talking about they&rsquo;re not going to disagree with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the pursuit of DRY in absolute leave a trail of destruction in its
wake.  I prefer to think of it as an indicator, or early warning signal for my
abstractions.  If I see a fair amount of repetition in my code, I question if
my abstractions are quite right.  If I seem to be able to express quite a lot
with very little code, and not a huge number of functions and modules, I see it
as good sign that the abstractions are about right.</p>
<p>I could take verbose and repetitive code, and chop it up into loads of
functions and squirrel them away in modules &ldquo;utils_1&rdquo;, &ldquo;utils_2&rdquo;, &amp;
&ldquo;utils_3&rdquo;, and I would have &ldquo;achieved DRY&rdquo;.  But the code would be more all
over the place than when I started and I wouldn&rsquo;t have addressed the underlying
cause of the problem: that the abstractions were just wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dry can be a sign of good abstractions, but not a goal in itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So work on your abstractions, and the repetition will fall away as you get them
right.</p>
