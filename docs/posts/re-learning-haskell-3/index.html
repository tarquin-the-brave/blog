    <p>After <a href="https://tarquin-the-brave.github.io/blog/posts/re-learning-haskell-2/">Part 2</a>, I wanted to go and do some reading. I felt like I could
crack on with the Advent of Code problems with the tools I had at my disposal,
but felt if I learned more Haskell I could be doing better.  I wanted to learn
some more about monad transformers and anything else that could improve my
solutions.</p>
<p>So I started search around to see what resources I could find.</p>
<h1 id="re-relearning-haskell-without-advent-of-code">(Re-)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>Learning Haskell with(out) Advent of Code</h1>
<p>After looking around a little, I stumbled upon <a href="https://tech.fpcomplete.com/haskell/learn">the Haskell learning
resources shared by FP Complete</a>. There&rsquo;s so many goodies here!</p>
<p>I ran through tutorials on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applicative Syntax,</li>
<li>String Types,</li>
<li>Strictness,</li>
<li>lenses,</li>
<li>The RIO library,</li>
<li>Monad Transformers, and</li>
<li>Vectors</li>
</ul>
<p>This only scratched the surface of what&rsquo;s available there.  It&rsquo;s definitely a
resource I will be revisiting.</p>
<p>Armed with these newly learnt learnings, I went back to my Advent of Code
solutions to see how I could improve them. 👷 🔧</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="small-improvements">Small Improvements</h1>
<p>Some small improvements I picked up as handy tips or on a 2nd look saw as
obvious and trivial.</p>
<h2 id="writing-stack-scripts">Writing Stack Scripts</h2>
<p>For the simpler problems, I didn&rsquo;t need the overhead of generating a full
project with <code>stack new</code> and opted to replace that with a single <code>dayX.hs</code>
script which starts like:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resovler lts-15.4 script
</code></pre><p>I&rsquo;d gone with the full project structure, given by the default template used by
<code>stack new</code>, to get used to importing and exporting and to find the namespacing
control I was happy with.  I&rsquo;ve done that now, so I can reduce some of the
problems to simple scripts and &ldquo;get things done!&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="using-where-more">Using <code>where</code> More</h2>
<p>As I elucidated on in <a href="https://tarquin-the-brave.github.io/blog/posts/re-learning-haskell-2/">Part 2</a>, my earlier solutions were plagued with
the proliferation of small functions that don&rsquo;t really mean a huge amount on
their own and are only called as part of another function.  <code>where</code> helps to
clean this up by putting them inside the namespace of the function they&rsquo;re
really part of and de-cluttering the namespace of the module.</p>
<h2 id="use-foldl-over-foldl">Use <code>foldl'</code> Over <code>foldl</code></h2>
<p>&ldquo;For strict application of the operator&rdquo; - <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Data-Foldable.html#v:foldl-39-">the docs say</a>.</p>
<p>As I understand it, a lazy fold would build up a giant chain of thunks which,
if the folding operation were cheap, would be more costly than strict
evaluation.</p>
<h2 id="where-a-list-was-very-slow">Where a List Was Very Slow</h2>
<p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/3">Day 3</a>, which was the first real problem I tackled in this exercise to
re-learn Haskell, has you drawing wires on a grid and finding where they cross.</p>
<p>I was using a long <code>List</code> for each &ldquo;wire&rdquo; to store the coordinates it passed
through, then finding where two wires had crossed by putting a function that
matches the coordinates in an applicative functor across the two lists.  This
ends up scaling with order <code>m * n</code> as the wires get longer.</p>
<p>Essentially <code>List</code> was a terrible choice of data structure for this.  Lists
provide an ordering of their data, and allow you to express duplicates.  We
want the answer to the question: &ldquo;what points has a path visited?&quot;, we don&rsquo;t
care about the answers to &ldquo;what order did the path visit those points in?&quot;, and
&ldquo;were any points visited more than once?&quot;.  But by choosing <code>List</code>, or any
other ordered collection that allows duplicates, we pay for the answers to
those questions.</p>
<p>A simple refactor to store this data in <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unordered-containers-0.2.10.0/docs/Data-HashSet.html#t:HashSet"><code>HashSet</code>s</a>, and finding the
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unordered-containers-0.2.10.0/docs/Data-HashSet.html#v:intersection">intersection</a> to get the points where the wires crossed reduced the
runtime of my solution from over 8 minutes, to 0.8 seconds.</p>
<h2 id="deriving-instances">Deriving Instances</h2>
<p>In Rust, I use the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/derive.html"><code>#[derive()]</code></a> attribute <em>a lot</em>. More often
than not, defining some <code>struct</code>s and <code>emun</code>s to declare what aggregates of
data matter becomes the cornerstone of any program I write.  Derive macros, via
<a href="https://serde.rs/"><code>serde</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/structopt/0.3.14/structopt/"><code>structopt</code></a>, are &ldquo;how we do&rdquo; serializing and
deserializing data, and building CLIs.  I&rsquo;ve even written my own derive macros
recently. It&rsquo;s fair to say: Rust would be a very different language without
derive macros.  I was going to say &ldquo;completely fucking unusable&rdquo;, but I started
to imagine a world where defining your own types was significantly more
expensive, where people defined their data aggregates in a more anonymous, ad
hoc manner, using generally available collection types, with a smattering of
type aliases.  Perhaps there&rsquo;s some advantages to that style.  At least it
would stop people writing reams of code to build spaghetti-like systems of
entirely entangled &ldquo;objects&rdquo; that go right round the houses, dig holes, fill
them back up again, pull in some state from who knows where or when, all just
to &ldquo;do a thing&rdquo;, espousing virtues of &ldquo;encapsulation&rdquo; and <a href="https://tarquin-the-brave.github.io/blog/posts/dry-not-a-goal/">&ldquo;DRY&rdquo; (at all
costs)</a>.  I&rsquo;ve seen code like that in Rust.  Defining your own types
provides a lot of control and correctness to your program, as you can lean hard
on the type system, but as with anything, there are costs as well.</p>
<p>Anyway, while writing Haskell I&rsquo;ve been trying to use <code>deriving</code> as much as
possible. One thing I picked up from <a href="https://tech.fpcomplete.com/haskell/learn">FP Complete&rsquo;s tutorials</a> was the
<code>DeriveFunctor</code> language extension. In <a href="https://tarquin-the-brave.github.io/blog/posts/re-learning-haskell-2/">Part 2</a> I refactored my Intcode
Computer solution to define and use my own Monad instance.  It was good to go
back and delete the 5 lines of code that defined the Functor instance.</p>

<h2 id="using-git-dependencies-with-stack">Using Git Dependencies with Stack</h2>
<p>As part of my refactored Intcode Computer solution in <a href="https://tarquin-the-brave.github.io/blog/posts/re-learning-haskell-2/">Part 2</a> I had to
fork and update the <code>base</code> version in <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-laws">a library that provided testing of
Monad, Applicative, Functor, and Monoid Laws</a>.  I then included my
fork as a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">git submodule</a> and pointed Stack at the dependency in the
local file system.  This was a good bit of practice with git submodules.  I&rsquo;ve
found git submodules to be something that you never use, until you have to, and
then you get it all spectacularly wrong and end up very confused.  But as the
theme of this post is about tidying up and refactoring, I changed this to tell
stack to get my fork <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/yaml_configuration/#extra-deps">from git</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="big-changes">Big Changes</h1>
<p>For me, the biggest difference coming back to my solutions was more down to
having more experience and confidence in the language, and coming at the code,
with a view to cleaning up the expressions and abstractions rather than wanting
to get the answer to plug into Advent of Code so it&rsquo;ll give me a gold star.
⭐</p>
<p>Looking past the general code tidying, there were some specific things I&rsquo;d
learned from doing some of <a href="https://tech.fpcomplete.com/haskell/learn">FP Complete&rsquo;s tutorials</a> that I was able to apply to
my refactored solutions.</p>
<h2 id="stop-matching-maybes---more-monad-transformers">Stop Matching Maybes - More Monad Transformers</h2>
<p><em>Not a great first example, as it&rsquo;s very much a &ldquo;Big Not-Change&rdquo;, but I thought
it was worth a mention.</em></p>
<p>After going through some of FP Complete&rsquo;s tutorials on monad transformers, I
thought that I&rsquo;d go back to my solutions finding vast swathes of code, matching
on <code>Maybe</code>s and rip it all out in favour of monad transformer stacks.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t actually happen. There was actually relatively few cases where I
was matching <code>Maybe</code>s and they were quite tidily cleaned up by making the
function generic over <code>MonadFail</code> in stead, see below.</p>
<p>It could be that there weren&rsquo;t lots places where monad transformers could have
been used to really clean up my code.  Or perhaps the concept hasn&rsquo;t sunk in
enough for me to spot those places.  I had used <code>StateT</code> in one of my solutions
already so I could print out the state to terminal as it was evolving (covered
in <a href="https://tarquin-the-brave.github.io/blog/posts/re-learning-haskell-2/">Part 2</a>).  It might be easier to spot where they could be used when
I&rsquo;m writing something fresh, rather than revisiting and refactoring code that
was to some extent written around not knowing to use them.</p>
<h2 id="alternatively-use-monadfail">Alternatively, Use MonadFail</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://tarquin-the-brave.github.io/blog/posts/re-learning-haskell-2/">Part 2</a> I discussed a pattern I found of defining functions who&rsquo;s
result could represent a failure, as being generic over <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#t:MonadFail"><code>MonadFail</code></a>
and allowing the calling code to choose the instance of <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#t:MonadFail"><code>MonadFail</code></a> to
represent the failure.</p>
<p>My solution to <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/6">day 6</a> involved loading some data into a Tree, and at a
one point, finding the path to a given node. Trouble was, the code assumed the
given node existed in the tree, and if it didn&rsquo;t, the code didn&rsquo;t crash, it
gave a nonsensical answer. 😟</p>
<p>Using this pattern, this code was surprisingly easy to fix.  My function
<code>orbitalHops</code> which told you how many hops there were between two nodes of a
tree was fixed up to look like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#66d9ef">import</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">qualified</span> Data.Tree <span style="color:#66d9ef">as</span> T

</code></pre></div><p>In my example of using this pattern with <code>MonadFail</code> in <a href="https://tarquin-the-brave.github.io/blog/posts/re-learning-haskell-2/">Part 2</a>, there
was a top level function who&rsquo;s type gave <code>m</code> a concrete type.  This time, I
used the fact that <code>IO</code> implements <code>MonadFail</code> and passed the non-concrete <code>m</code>
up to <code>main</code> to let the script fail with the error above if a node given was
not in the data.</p>
<p>In <code>main</code> I had:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#a6e22e">orbitalHops</span> orbitTree <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">YOU</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">SAN</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;&gt;=</span> print
</code></pre></div><p>Causing the script to either print the number of orbital hops between <code>&quot;YOU&quot;</code> &amp;
<code>&quot;SAN&quot;</code> or fail with the error above, provided by the call to <code>fail</code>.</p>
<h2 id="no-more-strings">No More Strings</h2>
<p>The wisdom appears to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use <code>String</code>, use <code>Text</code> (or <code>ByteString</code> for raw data)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which a quick google will provide pretty solid justification for, so I&rsquo;ll not
repeat it here.</p>
<p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/6">Day 6</a> was also the first problem where the input data remained as a
string throughout the program and some string manipulation was performed.</p>
<p>I was bracing myself for a bit of a fight to update the solution from using
<code>String</code> to using <code>Text</code>, but actually found I could do an almost like for like
replacement.</p>
<p>I made some new imports:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#66d9ef">import</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">qualified</span> Data.Text <span style="color:#66d9ef">as</span> Txt  <span style="color:#f92672">//</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">I</span> was already importing <span style="color:#66d9ef">Data</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">Tree</span> as <span style="color:#66d9ef">T</span>, so went with <span style="color:#66d9ef">Txt</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">import</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">qualified</span> Data.Text.Encoding <span style="color:#66d9ef">as</span> TE
<span style="color:#66d9ef">import</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">qualified</span> Data.ByteString <span style="color:#66d9ef">as</span> B
<span style="color:#66d9ef">import</span> Data.Monoid ((<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;&gt;</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>and removed another: <code>import Data.List.Split (splitOn)</code>, then:</p>
<p>Swapped <code>String</code> for <code>Txt.Text</code> where it appeared in type statements.</p>
<p>Prepended <code>Txt.</code> to all the functions acting on strings.</p>
<p>Swapped the use of Prelude&rsquo;s <code>readFile</code> with <code>fmap TE.decodeUtf8 . B.readFile</code></p>
<p>And Replaced usages of <code>++</code> with <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The compiler picked up a couple of places I&rsquo;d missed and voilà, the script ran
as it did before.</p>
<p>I was able to completely remove <code>String</code> from the program, with one exception:
the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:fail"><code>fail</code></a> function from <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#t:MonadFail"><code>MonadFail</code></a> takes a <code>String</code>.  This

<p>One of the reasons touted for <code>String</code>, a singly linked lazy list of <code>Char</code>s,
being a bad representation of textual data is that it&rsquo;s lazy.</p>
<p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/8">Day 8</a> was a good problem to experiment with as my solution involved
manipulating lists of characters, <code>[Char]</code>, a.k.a: <code>String</code>.</p>
<p>After refactoring the solution into a once page script and having a bit of a
tidy up, but otherwise leaving the substance of the code the same, I built
and ran the solution, in file <code>day8string.hs</code>, like so:</p>

<p>I imagine there&rsquo;s a few ways in which <code>Text</code> has been made to be more efficient
than <code>String</code>.  It&rsquo;s good to know that in the rarer case where you might want
to evaluate text lazily, lazy <code>Text</code> is still <em>that much more efficient</em> than

<p>This basic use of lenses with: auto-generation, getting, setting, and modifying
seems an obvious win for whenever I&rsquo;m defining my own data aggregate like this.
When I have types nested inside types, lenses&rsquo; composability will come in
handy.  I think it&rsquo;s going to be my default approach in future.</p>
<p>I looked through a couple of my other solutions to see where I had defined some
non-trivial aggregation of data where I could clean up the code with lenses.
My solutions to <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/11">Day 11</a> and <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/13">Day 13</a> both followed the same
pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defined the state that matters in a type, <code>s</code>,</li>
<li>Write a &ldquo;step function&rdquo; to progress that state, of the form <code>s -&gt; (a, s)</code>,
where <code>a</code> is some output of the computation,</li>
<li>Wrap that in <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.2/docs/Control-Monad-State-Lazy.html">the State Monad</a>,</li>
<li>And recurse, until some condition is met.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://tarquin-the-brave.github.io/blog/posts/re-learning-haskell-2/">Part 2</a> covers these solutions in more detail.</p>
<p>I started to look at refactoring these solutions to use lenses.  But the &ldquo;step
functions&rdquo; were pretty much the only places lenses could be applied, and these
functions did a &ldquo;bulk update&rdquo; of the state where every record is being changed.
In this cases, I think the record syntax looked clearer than a long chain of
lenses.</p>
<h2 id="deriving-default">Deriving Default</h2>
<p>While I was <a href="#lenses">refactoring the intcode solution to use lenses</a> to
access fields in the <code>Intcode</code> type, I also wanted to refactor the &ldquo;new&rdquo;

the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-deriving-1.13.1/docs/Generics-Deriving-Default.html">Generics.Deriving.Default</a> module.</p>

module appears to be a way to derive a default implementation of some class
instances rather than deriving the ability to default the value of type
<code>Intcode</code>.</p>
<p>Going back to the last error I tried also deriving <code>Generic</code>, as that was shown
in the examples in <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-deriving-1.13.1/docs/Generics-Deriving-Default.html">Generics.Deriving.Default</a>, and examples on the
homepage of the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/data-default-extra">data-default-extra</a> which I also looked at while
googling around.</p>
<pre><code>error:

<h2 id="replacing-lists-with-vectors">Replacing Lists with Vectors</h2>
<p>My solution to <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/10">Day 10</a> involved <em>a lot</em> of manipulating lists.  There
were <code>fmap</code>s, zips, folds, concats, all over the place.  Chances are, as with
the rest of the solutions I&rsquo;ve revisited, this logic could be simplified
somewhat.  But with it as it was, I saw it as a good exercise to convert to
using Vectors and see what the result was.</p>
<p>Firstly: which Vector? The elements are of type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#66d9ef">data</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">Point</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">Point</span>
  { px <span style="color:#f92672">::</span> <span style="color:#f92672">!</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">Int</span>
  , py <span style="color:#f92672">::</span> <span style="color:#f92672">!</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">Int</span>
  , pAst <span style="color:#f92672">::</span> <span style="color:#f92672">!</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">Bool</span>
  }
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">deriving</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">Show</span>, <span style="color:#66d9ef">Eq</span>, <span style="color:#66d9ef">Ord</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>which isn&rsquo;t a member of <code>Prim</code> or <code>Storable</code>, so we need a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.12.1.2/docs/Data-Vector.html">boxed Vector</a>.</p>
<p>Importing boxed vectors:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#66d9ef">import</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">qualified</span> Data.Vector <span style="color:#66d9ef">as</span> V
</code></pre></div><p>I set out making a copy of each function, <code>functionName'</code>, which worked on
Vectors instead of Lists. Once they all compiled, I switched <code>main</code> over to
using Vectors.</p>
<p>As the boxed <code>Vector</code> is a member of a lot of the same typeclasses, <code>Funtor</code>,
<code>Monad</code>, <code>Foldable</code>, etc, a fair amount of the code could stay the same.</p>
<p>For the cases where it couldn&rsquo;t, there was generally a function from
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.12.1.2/docs/Data-Vector.html">Data.Vector</a> that did the job.</p>
<p>Where I was previously providing some data with coordinates by zipping the List
with integers:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#a6e22e">zip</span> [<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span><span style="color:#f92672">..</span>]
</code></pre></div><p>I was able to instead call <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.12.1.2/docs/Data-Vector.html#v:indexed"><code>indexed</code></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#66d9ef">V</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>indexed
</code></pre></div><p>There was another place where I was putting a single value, <code>p</code>, in a List:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell">[p]
</code></pre></div><p>I went with <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.12.1.2/docs/Data-Vector.html#v:singleton"><code>singleton</code></a> for the vector case:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#66d9ef">V</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>singleton p
</code></pre></div><p>I could have also leveraged <code>Vector</code>'s <code>Applicative</code> or <code>Monad</code> instances with
<code>pure p</code> or <code>return p</code> respectively.</p>
<p>There were a few places where I&rsquo;d made use of <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/List_comprehension">List comprehensions</a>.
Replacing their usage with <code>fmap</code> and <code>filter</code> was fairly straight forward.  In
once case it made the code much simpler.  I had a function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell">(<span style="color:#a6e22e">\</span>ps <span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span> [p<span style="color:#f92672">|</span>p<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;-</span>ps, pAst p])
</code></pre></div><p>which instead could be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell">(filter pAst)
</code></pre></div><p>When I learned a bit of Haskell a few years ago I absolutely lived off List
comprehensions.  Perhaps because I was coming from Python at the time, and it
was a point of familiarity.  These days Rust is my primary language and I&rsquo;m
much more comfortable with maps and filters and the like.  I&rsquo;ve hardly used
List comprehensions this time around and I haven&rsquo;t really missed them.  In fact
when I first started writing Rust I came across the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cute">cute</a> crate that
lets you write Python style list comprehensions in Rust via a macro.  I liked
this, but after some code review feedback saying &ldquo;just get good at the Rust way
of doing it&rdquo;, I realised I was only holding onto this as a safety blanket,
so let it go.</p>
<p>I was thinking that I was mostly over List comprehensions and wouldn&rsquo;t use them
a huge amount going forward.  But then I found this on the internet: <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/monad-comprehensions">Monad
comprehensions</a>! I&rsquo;ve got to give these a spin at some point!</p>
<p>As with <a href="#no-more-strings">converting usages of <code>String</code> to <code>Text</code></a>, this went fairly
smoothly.  A lot of things work the same and for what isn&rsquo;t the same <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.12.1.2/docs/Data-Vector.html">the
documentation</a> is pretty good. My one complaint with the docs are that I
wish related modules&rsquo; docs linked to each other by default. I found myself
re-finding the package page on <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/">Hackage</a> and following the link to the
other module&rsquo;s docs from there.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what effect this change had on memory usage.  Running the solution

reasons why this might be.</p>
<p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/10">The problem</a> deals with line of sight between points on a

did this by folding over a <code>Set</code> of the points of interest to construct
a <code>Map</code> of points on each ray.</p>

<p>For Vectors, <code>(++)</code> is <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.12.1.2/docs/Data-Vector.html#v:-43--43-">of order O(m + n)</a> as the whole new combined
vector has to be allocated.  Granted, <code>m</code> is <code>1</code> in this case, but that leaves
us with an operation of order <code>n</code> where previously it was constant complexity.</p>
<p>I also had to convert the Vector to a List in two places using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.12.1.2/docs/Data-Vector.html#v:toList"><code>toList</code></a>.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t see a way to directly turn a Vector into a Set so resorted to:</p>

<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.12.1.2/docs/Data-Vector.html#v:concat"><code>V.concat</code></a> has signature <code>[ Vector a ] =&gt; Vector a</code>.  I couldn&rsquo;t
find another way of doing that so went with:</p>

performance, I don&rsquo;t know.</em></p>
<p>Looking at the input data, non of the rays are going to have more than around
10 points on them, so these Vectors aren&rsquo;t going to ever be that large, but
both of these things are work that isn&rsquo;t being done in the solution with Lists
and will come at a cost.</p>
<p>Are there any real savings? There might be some savings from Vector&rsquo;s
strictness, but from what I can tell, Vector&rsquo;s really out perform Lists when
they&rsquo;re being indexed.  This solution wasn&rsquo;t doing any indexing.</p>
<h2 id="using-sequence-to-model-intcode">Using Sequence to Model Intcode</h2>
<p>From the offset, when I first implemented a solution to <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2">Day 2</a>, which
introduces the problem of implementing an intcode computer, I knew storing the
intcode data in a List was going to be bad for performance as the intcode data
needed to be reference by index <em>a lot</em> and have values at specific indices
updated.</p>
<p>I made a note to come back to it later, figuring that as the intcode computer
implementation is built up over days 2, 5, 7, and 9, after implementing them
I know all the things I need to do with the data, and choose a replacement for
List then.  This did mean that I&rsquo;d built up a solution around using Lists,
but I backed myself to keeps things modular.</p>
<p>After considering a few options, I decided I liked what I saw in <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.6.2.1/docs/Data-Sequence.html"><code>Data.Sequence</code></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Logarithmic-time access to any element&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;Logarithmic-time concatenation&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;Constant-time access to both the front and the rear&rdquo; - appending and prepending,</li>
<li>The ability to change a value at an index with <code>update</code>, and</li>
<li>A List-like interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>The refactor went pretty smoothly.  The List-like interface meant a lot of
functions could be replaced like-for-like and those that couldn&rsquo;t had a fairly
obvious replacement found in <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.6.2.1/docs/Data-Sequence.html">the docs</a>.  It having instances of
<code>Functor</code>, <code>Foldable</code>, and <code>Monad</code> meant a lot of the code could stay the same.</p>
<p>The part of the code that looked after updating values in the intcode,
according to the rules set in the problem, ended up looking a lot cleaner.</p>

<h2 id="generalising-over-vectors">Generalising over Vectors</h2>
<p>After converting my <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/10">Day 10</a> solution from using Lists to boxed Vectors,
and finding the <a href="#performance">performance to be worse</a>, I was going to see
what the effect of refactoring the solution to use <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.12.1.2/docs/Data-Vector-Unboxed.html">unboxed Vectors</a>
would be.</p>
<p>My plan for this was to refactor the solution to be generic over vector types
by writing it in terms of <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.12.1.2/docs/Data-Vector-Generic.html">Data.Vector.Generic</a>, and then swapping
the concrete vector type used, at (hopefully) the single point where that was
defined.</p>
<p>I made a start on this, and I&rsquo;m reasonably happy with a process of swapping out
the module behind the qualified import, and where there are compile errors,
using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.12.1.2/docs/Data-Vector-Generic.html">the documentation</a> to find an equivalent function.  The
only issue was there was a lot of this to do, and I lost the will to do it somewhat.
I think a better approach will be: next time I&rsquo;m writing something to use
Vectors, try to write it with generic Vectors and see where that leads.</p>
<p>There was one specific thing I hit, that I fixed, but didn&rsquo;t fully
understand. In the boxed Vector solution I defined the &ldquo;rays&rdquo; that different
grid points lived on with a map of angle from the vertical to a Vector of
grid points (<code>Point</code>).  I had the type alias:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#66d9ef">type</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">Foo</span> v <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">Map</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">Map</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">Int</span> (v <span style="color:#66d9ef">Int</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>I did a bit of googling around &ldquo;<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/impredicative-polymorphism">impredicative polymorphism</a>&rdquo; and it looks like
I&rsquo;ve got a bit of reading to do before I understand this one, and why it was
hit for these functions but not others that both take and return <code>Rays v</code>.</p>
<p>For now my take away is: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t put constraints in type aliases&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="mutable-vector-to-model-intcode">Mutable Vector to Model Intcode</h2>
<p>Before I settled on <a href="#using-sequence-to-model-intcode">choosing a Sequence to represent the intcode
program</a>, I was looking into representing it in a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.12.1.2/docs/Data-Vector-Mutable.html">mutable Vector</a>
as elements have to be changed a lot, I thought that might be more efficient.</p>
<p>But unlike with Sequence, where I was able to pretty much swap out Lists for
Sequences, changing a few function calls, but otherwise hardly changing the
surrounding functions or structure of the program, with mutable Vectors I&rsquo;d
need a fair amount of refactoring.  The <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.12.1.2/docs/Data-Vector-Mutable.html#g:10">functions that access
elements</a> all return a monad that would need handling.</p>
<p>In this case as well I thought a better approach would be to earmark mutable
vectors as something to try when attempting a future problem, rather than
trying to do a big refactor of an existing solution.</p>

<h1 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h1>
<h2 id="no-prelude-and-rio">No Prelude and RIO</h2>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve refactored a fair few of my solutions to not use <code>String</code> and
<code>List</code>, I&rsquo;m hardly using Prelude at all in some of them.</p>
<p>I think in next Advent of Code problem I attempt, I&rsquo;ll start by putting</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#75715e">{-</span><span style="color:#75715e"># LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #</span><span style="color:#75715e">-}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>at the top of the file and using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio">RIO</a> as a Prelude replacement and
build the solution inside the RIO monad.</p>

<h1 id="what-next">What Next?</h1>
<p>More Advent of Code I guess&hellip;</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve done a &ldquo;big refactor&rdquo; of my existing solutions, the next thing to do
would be to crack on with some new Advent of Code problems.  I&rsquo;m not in any
particular rush to get through them.  I&rsquo;m finding them a decent backdrop to
learn things with, and the sooner I finish them, the sooner I have to look
elsewhere for fresh problems.  I&rsquo;m definitely in the state of mind of seeing
how much I can learn from doing a solution before moving onto the next one.</p>
<p>In the process of attempting more problems I&rsquo;m definitely going to return to <a href="https://tech.fpcomplete.com/haskell/learn">FP
Complete&rsquo;s Tutorials</a>, both for when I&rsquo;m looking to learn something
specific that they cover, and for when I&rsquo;m speculating on what might be useful
for an Advent of Code problem. I see they have a tutorial on performance
profiling which I&rsquo;m keen to look into.  In this blog post I&rsquo;ve not been
particularly rigorous when commenting on performance, and at some point I&rsquo;d
like to do some proper benchmarking on the choice of types in some solutions.</p>
<p><em>All the changes I&rsquo;ve made are recorded in <a href="https://github.com/tarquin-the-brave/aoc-19-haskell/pull/1/files">this monster pull request</a>
(which seems to have done a decent job of following when I changed entire Stack
project directories into single page scripts).</em> 💃</p>

<p>By this stage, and really by the time I got to <a href="https://tarquin-the-brave.github.io/blog/posts/re-learning-haskell-2/">Part 2</a>, I&rsquo;m no
longer &ldquo;Re-learning&rdquo; Haskell as I&rsquo;ve gone far beyond the level I got to when I
learned some Haskell a few years ago.  I started this blog series with
&ldquo;re-learning&rdquo;, so for continuity&rsquo;s sake I&rsquo;ll keep the title as it is. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
