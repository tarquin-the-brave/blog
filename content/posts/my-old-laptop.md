4 1/2 years ago, moving to London for a job.

Physics degree, didn't know much about tech,
knew enough to know if I wasn't doing any serious
gaming, I wouldn't need anything powerful.

bought ASUS eBook for ~£180

PCWorld, insisted on adding McAfee, at a cost of £50,
they pushed, I refused, then they offered it for free,
fine then.

2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM, 28 GB Disk.

McAfee took 2 days to "update" on first boot.

Windows 10 - all good for about 6-9 months.  Then the OS
got too big for the disk, stuck in the loop every day:
blue screen, grind away attempt update, say it can't update,
then I can use it.

I deleted everything I could as a normal user, still not enough.
I went into admin mode command prompt, installed a windows shim
of `du` and went hunting for files to delete.  Things broke.

I researched light weight linux distros, puppy, lubuntu.

Bootstrapped the machine onto lubuntu, navigating vendor lock in
in boot menu settings.

I don't want this to be "a guide to how to bootstrap a machine
onto linux" because I don't want to give bad advice.  I don't think
I was successful at finding good advice.

Lubuntu: minimal, quirky, loved it.

Gave it a name: Larry.

I added xMonad. Super tuned setup, felt very powerful. TWM are awesome.

Connecting to a TV.

Camera not working in a remote coding interview.

Battery problems.

Eventually gave in and got more powerful system, linux pre installed.

Larry got me a long way. RIP.
